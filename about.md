## About

I am Eric Saxby. I sometimes identify myself with the following words,
among others: programmer, musician, human being, reader, writer, artist,
traveller.

I currently work at Wanelo. In the past, I have worked at various
institutions including art museums and galleries, banks and fashion
startups. I have painted walls, operated hammer drills into sixty foot
ceilings and helped carpenters by writing out what I thought was simple
trigonometry. I have wired together power cables and managed not to kill myself.
I written recursive shell scripts to transform large amounts of data
into HTML via XSLT. I have shown art at several galleries, and at one
point I tried to write and illustrate a graphic novel. More recently I
have written web applications and system automation using various frameworks.
