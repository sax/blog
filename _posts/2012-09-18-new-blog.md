Well, it's time. While the old blog had some relevant data (at least to me),
it's time to shuck off the old and begin with the new. As such, I'm
going to rely on the [Internet Archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20110201094856/http://ericsaxby.com/blog/) 
to provide historical content.

The analytics of my previous blog and the random connections it would attract
were interesting, but there are a few deciding factors to guide this
along:

* I have not updated it in about 2 1/2 years
* Most of the content is technologically dated
* Since last writing, I have switched jobs twice (more on that in a
  later post)
